This repository is a super simple demonstration of connecting to an Oracle database from Golang.

## What does it do?

Print the date.

## How do I use this?

I wrote some instructions for Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing databases [here](https://medium.com/@iamtheyammer/connecting-to-an-oracle-autonomous-transaction-processing-database-on-your-mac-239f7513b86e?source=friends_link&sk=550a7e27cfb3b7e2820b70f5bd06454d).

Otherwise, make sure you change `connString` in `main.go`.
